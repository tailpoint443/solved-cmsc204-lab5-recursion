Lab 5

You will need to complete two recursive methods for this lab assignment.

<ul>

 <li>Write a recursive method to sum the values in an array of integers. You will need to implement a recursive method, int sumOfArray (…), in a new java file.

  <ul>

   <li>Use the provided driver, ArraySumDriver, to populate your array and demonstrate that your method works. Feel free to modify the driver routine</li>

   <li>Note that ArraySumDriver has a getArray method that you will need to use. Also, you are encouraged to use sumOfArray() as a “starter” method, that calls the actual recursive method</li>

  </ul></li>

 <li>Implement another recursive method to compute a Fibonacci number

  <ul>

   <li>Review the Dynamic Programming slides (Module 9 – Recursion.pptx) and utilize the dynamic programming version</li>

   <li>The pseudocode has been provided, and this is the most efficient implementation</li>

   <li>Add addition testing code (to the provided driver routine) to test your newly created Fibonacci routine</li>

  </ul></li>

</ul>
